                    <p>The EU and its money flows are notoriously complex and partially intransparent. Over the past
                        year, the team behind <a href="http://subsidystories.eu">SubsidyStories.eu</a> has gathered,
                        cleaned, and concatenated data on the EU’s most important financial instrument: the European
                        Structural Investment Funds (ESIF). Together with representatives of different disciplines
                        (journalists, developers, domain experts, and designers) we want to immerse ourselves in the
                        this data, hunting for stories.

                    That is why the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany has worked over the past year to open the data on EU subsidies with subsidystories.eu. This is only the beginning of our EU Transparency work and we invite the participants to work with this data together with us on analysing money flows and increasing EU Transparency.
