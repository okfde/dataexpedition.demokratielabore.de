                    <p>The EU and its money flows are notoriously complex and partially intransparent. Over the past
                        year, the team behind <a href="http://subsidystories.eu">SubsidyStories.eu</a> has gathered,
                        cleaned, and concatenated data on the EUâ€™s most important financial instrument: the European
                        Structural Investment Funds (ESIF). Together with representatives of different disciplines
                        (journalists, developers, domain experts, and designers) we want to immerse ourselves in the
                        this data, hunting for stories.

                        That is why Open Knowledge Germany has worked over the past year to open data on EU subsidies
                        with subsidystories.eu. This is only the beginning of our EU Transparency work and we would
                        invite the participants to work with this data, and work together with us on topics in EU
                        Transparency.
