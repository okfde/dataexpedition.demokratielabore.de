                    <p>The EU and its money flows are notoriously complex and intransparent. In an effort to change this, the team behind <a href="http://subsidystories.eu">SubsidyStories.eu</a> has gathered, cleaned, and concatenated data on the EU’s most important financial instrument: the European Structural Investment Funds (ESIF).</p> 
                    <p>Together with representatives of different disciplines (journalists, developers, domain experts, and designers) we want to immerse ourselves in the data, hunting for stories.

                    Together with the teams of Datenschule and OpenBudgets.eu we will first host data training sessions in Berlin, advancing their data literacy skills for the following workshop in the end of June. On this three day workshop, the Training’s participants will work together with 25 experts from the field of journalism, programming, advocacy, and design to work on data, analysis and storytelling. <!--You can view <a href="http://openbudgets.eu/assets/resources/Report-OpenBudgets-ESIF%20Data-Quality-Index.pdf"> a report on the data here</a>.-->
