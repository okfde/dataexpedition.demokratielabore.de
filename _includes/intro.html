                        journalists, domain-experts, developers and designers , we want to develop and practice the
                        skills needed to hunt stories in financial data.

                        The programme is split into two separate parts: a series of <b>Trainings</b> and a weekend-long
                        <b>Data Expedition</b> in a forgotten castle outside of Berlin.

                        The bootcamp is tailored to aspiring data journalists that are interested in improving their
                        data skills. The trainings will culminate in the workshop at end of June, where - together with
                        proven experts - we are going to dive into a massive database of the European Unionâ€™s primary
                        financial instrument, the <a
                            href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/european-structural-and-investment-funds_en">ESIFunds</a>.
                        During the expedition we will form interdisciplinary teams that collaboratively work on finding
                        stories, leads, and doing analysis on data around the EU and its money flows. This will offer an
                        ideal opportunity to practice the acquired skills in a supportive environment.
